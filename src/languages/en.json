    "title": "About Me",
    "paragraph1": "Recently graduated from Oulu University of Applied Sciences, where I completed my degree in Computer Engineering. My academic career has equipped me with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development.",
    "paragraph2": "I enjoy building applications that are not only functional but also pleasant to use. I am particularly interested in full-stack development and love the process of turning ideas into reality.",
    "paragraph3": "Outside of coding, I'm a pretty laid-back person who gets along with everyone. I like to unwind by playing video games, watching football or racing. My girlfriend and I have two cats that definitely make things interesting. I believe staying curious and having fun outside of work helps me stay sharp and creative in what I do."
